# Nice Node.js modules and resources

I find it really hard to remember which modules are good and what they are useful for... so here is my scractchpad for future reference

## Fundamentals
- [Request](https://github.com/request/request) Easy HTTP requests, especially good for webhooks
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) HTTP requests with Promises and JSON transformation built in. Great for API consumption

## Database
- [Level](https://github.com/Level/level) Fast key/value data store based on Google LevelDB
