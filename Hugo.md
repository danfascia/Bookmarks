# Hugo stuff

A list of links and resources to help making static sites with [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io)

## GoTemplate
* [Hash anchor links for headings](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/adding-anchor-next-to-headers/1726) This is really useful for documentation style sites

## Fundamentals
* [Hugo Content Structure](https://www.jakewiesler.com/blog/hugo-directory-structure/) Much clearer explanation than the docs
* [Better Relationships with Hugo](https://regisphilibert.com/blog/2018/04/hugo-optmized-relashionships-with-related-content/)
* [Hugo, the scope, the context and the dot](https://regisphilibert.com/blog/2018/02/hugo-the-scope-the-context-and-the-dot/) Probably one of the hardest concepts to grasp
* [Page Resources and Bundles](https://regisphilibert.com/blog/2018/01/hugo-page-resources-and-how-to-use-them/)
* [Scratch Variables](https://regisphilibert.com/blog/2017/04/hugo-scratch-explained-variable/)
